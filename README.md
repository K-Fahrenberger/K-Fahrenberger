# Hi there, I'm Kevin!
I'm an upcoming Full-Stack developer based in Berlin. For now I'm learning the ropes of CSS, HTML and Javascript. I do have a psychology background and used to work in social services. I used to be a passionate bodybuilder and mixed-martial-artist. I hope to learn a lot in the IT-bootcamp that I'm currently signed up for.
